/**
 * SCRIPT DATA JSON
 * - this is used to define what info you what to return from OA
 * - the info is returned as a data object which is loaded on the template script as the object 'data'
 * - retrieving the data from OA is way DOES NOT use the rest api but some other process
 * - this means you may find your templates behaving differently compared to wizard based templates
 * - it's not currently possible to return file-based keyword info
 * - returning displayFields and imageSizes must entered as a comma separated string and NOT an array
